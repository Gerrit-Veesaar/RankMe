# RankMe 1 Vision
The RankMe app reimagines dating by integrating a simple yet powerful 5-star rating system:

User Ratings: Every profile is rated by others, with 1-5 stars reflecting factors like attractiveness, hobbies, and overall compatibility.
Enhanced Feedback: Users can also leave private or public(maybe as an future feature) comments for additional context, promoting personal growth and better connections.
Fun, Interactive, and Respectful: RankMe aims to make dating engaging while maintaining a respectful, non-toxic community environment.

3. Goals

The goal of RankMe is to:

Reinvent Online Dating: Move beyond superficial swiping by introducing a rating system based on multiple aspects of compatibility and attraction.
Create Transparent Feedback Loops: Allow users to learn from ratings and comments, leading to self-awareness and improvement.
Foster Meaningful Connections: Through the ratings system, users are matched based on shared interests and mutual ratings, creating better matches.

4. Features
